# ðŸš€ ROCAT DATASET

This repository provides a trajectory dataset of 20 diverse objects with varying shapes and physical properties, each exhibiting different aerodynamic dynamics. The dataset has been specifically collected and designed to support research in **robotics, motion prediction, reinforcement learning, and dynamic modeling**. It serves as one of the main contributions of the project [DIPP: Discriminative Impact Point Predictor for Catching Diverse In-Flight Objects](https://sites.google.com/view/robot-catching-2025/ãƒ›ãƒ¼ãƒ ).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- 20 distinct objects with varying shapes and physical properties, each exhibiting different aerodynamic behaviors.
- Recorded motion features
    - including features: position, velocity, acceleration
    - collection rate: 120hz
    - motion capture system: OptiTrack

## ðŸ“¥ Download & Usage

You can download the dataset by cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ngochuy2137/DIPP_dataset.git
```
